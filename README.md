# MoDCloth Fit Prediction Using Machine Learning

### Abstract
MoD Cloth fit Prediction is used to predict the size of a particular Mod Cloth product fit for the customer. Fit prediction is critical in order to improve customers’ shopping experiences and to reduce product return rates. Modelling customers’ fit feedback is challenging due to its subtle semantics, arising from the subjective evaluation of products, and imbalanced label distribution. This project proposes a new predictive framework to tackle the product fit problem, which captures the customers’ feedback on the product fit, and employs a metric learning technique to resolve the issues.It also contribute the public dataset collected from online clothing retailer (MoD Cloth). The whole dataset is split into training and testing sets. This dataset is useful in identifying key features that determine the fit of a clothing product on a customer. Random Forest algorithm is applied to predict the Size of the product.

### Steps to implement the Project
1. Download the project and open it in Google Colaboratory.
2. Mount the Google Drive and load the dataset in the form of csv data
3. Install the Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn libraries (using pip install)
4. Run the project to get the results
