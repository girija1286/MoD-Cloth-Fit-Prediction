    \textbf{\Large ABSTRACT}\\
\end{center}

\begin{normalsize}
MoD Cloth fit Prediction is used to predict the size of a particular Mod Cloth product fit for the customer. Fit prediction is critical in order to improve customers’ shopping experiences and to reduce product return rates. Modelling customers’ fit feedback is challenging due to its subtle semantics, arising from the subjective evaluation of products, and imbalanced label distribution. This project proposes a new predictive framework to tackle the product fit problem, which captures the customers’ feedback on the product fit, and employs a metric learning technique to resolve the issues. It also contribute the public dataset collected from online clothing retailer (MoD Cloth). The whole dataset is split into training and testing sets.
This dataset is useful in identifying key features that determine the fit of a clothing product on a customer. Random Forest algorithm is applied to predict the Size of the product.

\section{\Large INTRODUCTION}
\end{center}
\\
\tab With the growth of the online fashion industry and the wide size variations across different
clothing products, automatically providing accurate and personalized fit guidance is worthy of
interest. As retailers often allow customers to provide fit feedback (e.g. “small”, “fit”, “large”)
during the product return process or when leaving reviews, predictive models have been recently
developed based on this kind of data [1, 8, 9]. A few recent approaches to this problem use two
sets of latent variables to recover products and customers’ “true” sizes, and model the fit as a
function of the difference between the two variables [8, 9].
\\\\
However, we notice that customers’ fit feedback reflects not only the objective match/mismatch
between a product’s true size and a customer’s measurements, but also depends on other
subjective characteristics of a product’s style and properties. We see two customers expressing
concerns that a jacket seems ‘baggy,’ but both have different feedback regarding this fit
shortcoming. Additionally, such fit feedback is ordinal in nature and is unevenly distributed
(most transactions are reported as “fit”), which differs from general item recommendation tasks
and requires domain-specific techniques.
\\\\
In this we pose product size recommendation problem as fit prediction problem and tackle the
aforementioned challenges in the following ways: First, unlike previous work which focuses on
recovering “true” sizes, we develop a new model to factorize the semantics of customers’ fit
feedback, so that representations can capture customers’ fit preferences on various product
aspects (like shoulders, waist etc.).
\\\\\\\\\\\\
We apply an ordinal regression procedure to learn these representations such that the order of
labels is preserved. Second, using a heuristic we sample good representations from each class
and project them to a metric space to address label imbalance issues. We
collect customers’ fit feedback from two different clothing websites and contribute two public
datasets. Through experiments on these datasets, we show the effectiveness of uncovering fine
grained aspects of fit feedback and highlight the ability of metric learning approaches with
prototyping in handling label imbalance issues.
\\\\
\begin{large}
\textbf{1.1 OBJECTIVE }
\end{large}
\begin{normalsize}
\\
The objective of Mod cloth Fit Prediction Using Machine Learning is that the size and fit
problem as a classification problem where given a product and a customer we want to predict if
the product will ’fit’ to the customer using the Random Forest algorithm, which is an supervised
learning algorithm.
\end{normalsize}
\\\\
\begin{large}
\textbf{1.2 PROBLEM DEFINITION}
\end{large}
\begin{normalsize}
\\
Given a customer C, a product P, and a set of reviews for the product R, we want to
predict if the product will be small, fit or large for the customer. Both product and customer are
defined by their respective features P = {pi} and C = {ci} where each feature can be either
continuous or categorical. R = {ri} consists of the reviews left by customers on the product page.
We define the output space as F = {(small, fit , large)}. \\\\
\end{normalsize}
\begin{large}
\textbf{1.3 AIM OF THE PROJECT}
\end{large}\\
\begin{normalsize}
The main aim of this project is to predict the size of a particular Mod Cloth product fit for the customer.The Fit prediction is critical in order to improve customers shopping experiences. This makes it easier for both the Producers and the consumers to reduce product return rates. The model helps the customers to know their required product size for a particular mod-cloth.

\section{ \Large LITERATURE SURVEY}
\end{center}
\begin{large}
\textbf{2.1 RELATED WORK}
\end{large}\\
• According to Shreya Singh, G Mohammed Abdulla, Sumit Borar and Sagar Arora.
 Mainly focuses on providing a production ready size
recommendation system for
shoes and address the
challenge of providing
recommendation for users. The product size recommendation problem is fairly recent with a only few studies proposed so
far [1, 8, 9]. One approach recovers products and customers’ “true” sizes and uses these as
features in a standard classifier for fit prediction [8]. In parallel to our work, another approach
extends the above method and proposes Bayesian logit and probit regression models with ordinal
categories to model fit [9]. Our approach differs from these studies in that we focus on capturing
fit semantics and handle label imbalance issues using metric learning approaches with
prototyping. Another recent approach uses skip-gram models to learn customers’ and products’
latent features [1]. However, this approach assumes the availability of platform-specific features
whereas our model works on more limited (and thus more readily available) transaction data.
\\
\\
• According to R Misra, M Wan and J. McAuley
 Proposed a new predictive
framework to tackle the product
fit problem, which captures the
semantics behind customers' fit
feedback, and employs a metric
learning technique to resolve
label imbalance issues.
Metric learning has previously been applied to several recommendation problems. For music
recommendation, one study encodes songs by their implicit feedback and employs metric
learning to retrieve songs similar to a query song [6]. Another study uses users’ meta-data to
build representations and employs metric learning to retrieve suitable partners for online dating
recommendation [7]. In contrast, we learn representations of transactions that capture the ordinal
nature of fit. Recently, collaborative filtering was combined with metric learning and its
effectiveness was shown on various recommendation tasks [3]. However, the approach (that
relies on binary implicit feedback data) does not translate directly to the ordinal nature of the
product size recommendation problem.
 \\\\\\
• According to Romain Guigourès, Yuen King Ho, Evgenii Koriagin, Abdul-Saboor Sheikh, Urs Bergmann, and Reza Shirvany
. Proposed a hierarchical Bayesian approach to tackle the challenging problem of size recommendation in e-commerce fashion. Our approach jointly models a size purchased by a customer, and its possible return event: 1. no return, 2. returned too small 3. returned too big.In this work, we focus on using customer reviews, purchases and
returns data of the customers, product information in predicting
the right fit for a customer. Customer reviews might contain crucial
size and fit information which might help in predicting the right
fit to a customer over using product and customer information
alone. To extract the information from customer reviews we have
embedded the reviews using a pre-trained language model [2]. 
\\\\
• According to G Mohammed Abdulla and Sumit Borar,
 Proposed a size recommendation system to automatically pre-select consumer’s size based on past purchase and content data without explicitly asking for users measurements.
 Many studies have used prototyping techniques with Nearest Neighbor based classification
methods. Köstinger et al. [5] propose to jointly identify good prototypes and learn a distance
metric, and also show that this leads to better generalization compared to k-Nearest Neighbor (k-
NN) classification. Another study proposes a novel algorithm for deriving optimal prototypes,
specifically for the 1-NN setting [11]. Following these lines, we develop a simple, fast and
effective heuristic to choose relevant prototypes for Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN).\\\\
\begin{large}
\textbf{2.1 Major Issues}
\end{large}\\
• The challenge for the MoD Cloth dataset is that there are many null values.\\• Converting height from inches to centimeters (Object to float).

\newpage

\begin{center}
\section{ \Large SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN}
\end{center}\\
\begin{large}
\textbf{3.1 PROPOSED SYSTEM}
\end{large}\\\
In the proposed system, the project will predict the size of a particular Mod Cloth product. It will
take the input of different parameters like product id, height, waist, bust size, foot size etc.
\\\\
Based on the issues with forecasting mistakes and the danger of overfitting brought on by huge
datasets. The results of the data analysis and submission to the company are inefficient and
ineffectual. In order to solve the issue, we can predict the size of particular product using the
applicable Random Forest technique.
\\\\
The Fit prediction is critical in order to improve customers shopping experiences. This makes it
easier for both the Producers and the consumers to reduce product return rates. The model helps
the customers to know their required product size / fit for a particular mod-cloth.\\

% The three main phases which we undergo for developing the application “Fruit Freshness Detection” is:\\
% 1)Data Collection\\
% 2)Deep Learning\\
% 3)Prediction\\\\
% In data collection, first we should collect the original fruit images and save them in one document as fresh fruits and rotten fruits. After that we should do data augmentation i.e; rescaling the images to avoid overfitting, rotating the images in different angles for comparison while predicting and zooming images. Then we perform normalization to normalize the dataset and split that dataset into test, train and validation.
% In deep learning, we will create the VGG model and train it. After training the model validation should be done. Finally, we need to test the model.
% In prediction, We can find the accuracy of model and plot the graph for accuracy and loss. Finally, prediction can be done by testing the model with new fruit images. Then the model will give result whether the fruit is fresh or rotten, if it is fresh how much percentage it is fresh and if it rotten how much percentage it is rotten.\\

\textbf{3.3 USE CASE DIAGRAM: }\\
\end{large}
A use case diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UM) is a type of behavioral diagram defined by and created from a Use-case analysis, Its purpose is to present a graphical overview of the functionality provided by a system in terms of actors, their goals (represented as use cases), and any dependencies between those use cases. The main purpose of a use case diagram is to show what system functions are performed for which actor. Roles of the actors in the system can be depicted.\\\\

% First, we have to load both fresh and rotten fruit images in the dataset then we have to split the dataset to train, test and validation. After splitting the dataset, we need to perform augmentation which is rescaling the images to avoid overfitting. After augmentation we need to build the VGG model and train the model. Once the training and validation of model is finished, we need to evaluate the model and finally prediction should be done by testing the model with new fruit images. Then the developed model will give the result of that image as fresh or rotten.

\item Evaluating the Model
\item Results
\end{enumerate}

\begin{large}
\textbf{4.2 PROPOSED ALGORITHM : }
\end{large}

\tab Based on the issues with overfitting risk brought on by huge datasets. The company's analysis of the data revealed that it was inefficient and unsuccessful. Thus, in order to solve the issue, we will predict the size of an MoD Cloth product for a particular customer using the Random Forest technique.
The Fit prediction is critical in order to improve customers' shopping experiences. This makes it easier for both the Producers and the consumers to reduce product return rates. The model helps the customers to know their required product size/fit for a particular mod cloth. The system makes advantage of the hips, cup size, bust size, bust, height, fit, and shoe size. With the use of this dataset, an supervised learning model is built, and it is then used to predict the size by taking the different parameters as input. The project's suggested methodology is broken down into six steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Raw Data
\item  Data PreProcessing
\item  Data visualization
\item  Testing Data
\item  Predicted the size/fit using the Algorithm
\item  Algorithm
\end{enumerate}
\\
\begin{large}
\textbf{4.2.1 RAW DATA: }
\end{large}
\\
\tab The term raw data refers to unprocessed data that is taken from a dataset or, in some cases, created as an output of data processing. Extraction, organizing, and occasionally analysis are the procedures needed for raw data. The data set consists of 82790 records. \\

\textbf{4.2.2 DATA PREPROCESSING: }
\end{large}
\\
\\
\tab MoD Cloth will collect a significant amount of data for testing and training purposes. The acquired dataset will be aggregated and categorized based on the review of the customers. These datasets will undergo data pre-processing when these criteria are taken into account. The project used data from the Kaggle named ModCloth dataset and imported using python libraries by selecting the required fields in the required format. Then converted some of the fields to the required format. Here height is converted from foot & inches to centimeters using regular expressions.

\textbf{4.2.3 DATA VISUALIZATION: }
\end{large}
\\
\tab Data visualization is the process of using graphs and performance metrics to assess a model's performance. The major use of data visualization is to reclassify the data into new categories so that the algorithm used can be expanded to include an observation of each output variable that results from an observed input variable. And data cleaning is performed based on the visualization.

\\
\textbf{4.2.4 TESTING DATA: }
\end{large}
\\
\tab Testing the data is the next important step after visualising the data in an algorithm; the test set may be defined as a set of used to assess the performance of a model using performance metrics. The programme that uses the test set must be able to generalise and perform well with the data set in order to accurately provide the expected data and produce a programme that is useful in nature. Furthermore, overfitting, which is when the computer memorises the data set, occurs when this happens. To balance overfitting, regularisation is used to apply to the model and reduce it.

\textbf{4.2.5 PREDICTING THE SIZE/FIT USING ALGORITHM: }
\end{large}
\\
\tab The proposed method predicts the size/fit of a particular MoD Cloth product by taking the parameters such as height, waist, bust, hip size, show size, etc. Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the supervised learning technique. Based on the concept of ensemble learning, which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance of the model.

\textbf{4.2.6 RANDOM FOREST: }
\end{large}
\\
\tab The algorithm used in this study is based on supervised learning. In contrast to unsupervised learning, there will be labeled data for this grouping. Based on the concept of ensemble learning, which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and to improve the performance of the model.

The algorithm is categorized into five steps:\\
• Select random K data points from the training set.\\
• Build the decision trees associated with the selected data points (Subsets).\\
• Choose the number N for the decision trees that you want to build.\\
• Repeat Steps 1 and 2.\\
• For new data points, find the predictions of each decision tree, and assign the new data points to the category that wins the majority votes.\\
\tab Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset. Instead of relying on one decision tree, the random forest takes the prediction from each tree and based on the majority votes of predictions, and predicts the final output.\\
\tab Since the random forest combines multiple trees to predict the class of the dataset, it is possible that some decision trees may predict the correct output, while others may not. But together, all the trees predict the correct output.

\tab Random Forest gives us the highest accuracy when compared to other algorithms. The model gives 98\% of training accuracy and 70\% testing accuracy. The model will predict the size by taking the parameters such as height, waist, bust, hip size, show size, etc.

\section{ \Large  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE}
\end{center}
\tab The project's conclusion is Size and Fit recommendation is an important problem in e-commerce because it helps customers in choosing the right fit and thereby reduces size and fit-related returns. Most of the earlier works embedded user and product information to predict the right fit. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based approach to predict the fit based on customer reviews along with customer and product information. Through extensive experimentation on different datasets curated from data of one of the largest e-commerce platforms, we show the
effectiveness of our approach.
\\\\
\tab We plan to extend this work by including other customer feedback like customer uploaded images and customer QnA to predict the right fit. Customers sometimes ask questions related to size and fit which get answered by other customers who have already bought the product. Also using customer-uploaded images along with product information might help the model to learn the interactions between the user and product to predict the right fit.

    \textbf{\Large ABSTRACT}\\
\end{center}

\begin{normalsize}
Fit prediction is critical in order to improve customers’ shopping experiences and to reduce
product return rates. Modelling customers’ fit feedback is challenging due to its subtle
semantics, arising from the subjective evaluation of products, and imbalanced label
distribution. In this project, we propose a new predictive framework to tackle the product fit
problem, which captures the semantics behind customers’ fit feedback, and employs a metric
learning technique to resolve label imbalance issues. We also contribute two public datasets
collected from online clothing retailers. The whole dataset is split into training and test sets.
This dataset is useful in identifying key features that determine the fit of a clothing product on
a customer. Then we apply algorithms to predict the output.

\section{\Large Introduction}
\end{center}
\\
\tab With the growth of the online fashion industry and the wide size variations across different
clothing products, automatically providing accurate and personalized fit guidance is worthy of
interest. As retailers often allow customers to provide fit feedback (e.g. “small”, “fit”, “large”)
during the product return process or when leaving reviews, predictive models have been recently
developed based on this kind of data [1, 8, 9]. A few recent approaches to this problem use two
sets of latent variables to recover products and customers’ “true” sizes, and model the fit as a
function of the difference between the two variables [8, 9].
\\\\
However, we notice that customers’ fit feedback reflects not only the objective match/mismatch
between a product’s true size and a customer’s measurements, but also depends on other
subjective characteristics of a product’s style and properties. We see two customers expressing
concerns that a jacket seems ‘baggy,’ but both have different feedback regarding this fit
shortcoming. Additionally, such fit feedback is ordinal in nature and is unevenly distributed
(most transactions are reported as “fit”), which differs from general item recommendation tasks
and requires domain-specific techniques.
\\\\
In this we pose product size recommendation problem as fit prediction problem and tackle the
aforementioned challenges in the following ways: First, unlike previous work which focuses on
recovering “true” sizes, we develop a new model to factorize the semantics of customers’ fit
feedback, so that representations can capture customers’ fit preferences on various product
aspects (like shoulders, waist etc.).
\\\\\\\\\\\\
We apply an ordinal regression procedure to learn these representations such that the order of
labels is preserved. Second, using a heuristic we sample good representations from each class
and project them to a metric space to address label imbalance issues. We
collect customers’ fit feedback from two different clothing websites and contribute two public
datasets. Through experiments on these datasets, we show the effectiveness of uncovering fine
grained aspects of fit feedback and highlight the ability of metric learning approaches with
prototyping in handling label imbalance issues.

\textbf{1.1 Objective }
\end{large}
\begin{normalsize}
\\
The objective of Mod cloth Fit Prediction Using Machine Learning is that the size and fit
problem as a classification problem where given a product and a customer we want to predict if
the product will ’fit’ to the customer using the Random Forest algorithm, which is an supervised
learning algorithm.
\end{normalsize}
\\\\
\begin{large}
\textbf{1.2 Problem Definition}
\end{large}
\begin{normalsize}
\\
Given a customer C, a product P, and a set of reviews for the product R, we want to
predict if the product will be small, fit or large for the customer. Both product and customer are
defined by their respective features P = {pi} and C = {ci} where each feature can be either
continuous or categorical. R = {ri} consists of the reviews left by customers on the product page.
We define the output space as F = {(small, fit , large)}. \\\\

The main aim of this project is to predict the size of a particular Mod Cloth product fit for
the customer.

• Saad Albawi, Tareq Abed Mohammed. The term Deep Learning or Deep Neural Nework refers to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with multi layers .Over the last few decades, it has been considered to be one of the most powerful tools, and has become very popular in the literature as it is able to handle a huge amount of data. The interest in having deeper hidden layers has recently begun to surpass classical methods performance in different fields; especially in pattern recognition. One of the most popular deep neural networks is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It take this name from mathematical linear operation between matrixes called convolution. CNN have multiple layers; including convolutional layer, non-linearity layer, pooling layer and fully-connected layer.

• Jin-Sung Kimast object detection is important to enable a vision-based automated vending machine. This paper proposes a new scheme to enhance the operation speed of YOLOv3 by removing the computation for the region of non-interest. In order to avoid the accuracy drop by a removal of computation, characteristics of a convolutiona layer and a YOLO layer are investigated, and a new processing method is proposed from experimental results. As a result, the operation speed is increased in proportion to the size of the region of non-interest. Experimental results show that the speed is improved by 3.29 times while the accuracy degradation is 2.81\% in MAP- 50. \\\\
• According to Dingan Liao, Hu Lu,Xingpei Xu, Quansheng Gao. Image segmentation is an important technique in image analysis. Existing methods in image segmentation rely on an artificial neural network to extract the feature of the image. In this study, we propose an image segmentation method based on deep learning features and community detection. We propose the use of a pre-trained convolution neural network (CNN) to extract the deep learning features of the image.
\\
\\
• According to Shuying Liu, Weihong Deng.Since Krizhevsky won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2012 competition with the brilliant deep convolutional neural networks(D-CNNs), re-searchers have designed lots of D-CNNs. However, almost all the existing very deep convolutional neural networks are trained on the giant ImageNet datasets. Small datasets like CIFAR-10 has rarely taken advantage of the power of depth since deep models are easy to overfit. In this paper, we pro-posed a modified VGG-16 network and used this model to fit CIFAR-10. By adding stronger regularizer and using Batch Normalization, we achieved 8.45\% error rate on CIFAR-10 without severe overfitting. \\\\

\textbf{3.1 Proposed System}
\end{large}\\\
In the proposed system, the project will predict the size of a particular Mod Cloth product. It will
take the input of different parameters like product id, height, waist, bust size, foot size etc.

Based on the issues with forecasting mistakes and the danger of overfitting brought on by huge
datasets. The results of the data analysis and submission to the company are inefficient and
ineffectual. In order to solve the issue, we can predict the size of particular product using the
applicable Random Forest technique.

The Fit prediction is critical in order to improve customers shopping experiences. This makes it
easier for both the Producers and the consumers to reduce product return rates. The model helps
the customers to know their required product size / fit for a particular mod-cloth.\\

% The three main phases which we undergo for developing the application “Fruit Freshness Detection” is:\\
% 1)Data Collection\\
% 2)Deep Learning\\
% 3)Prediction\\\\
% In data collection, first we should collect the original fruit images and save them in one document as fresh fruits and rotten fruits. After that we should do data augmentation i.e; rescaling the images to avoid overfitting, rotating the images in different angles for comparison while predicting and zooming images. Then we perform normalization to normalize the dataset and split that dataset into test, train and validation.
% In deep learning, we will create the VGG model and train it. After training the model validation should be done. Finally, we need to test the model.
% In prediction, We can find the accuracy of model and plot the graph for accuracy and loss. Finally, prediction can be done by testing the model with new fruit images. Then the model will give result whether the fruit is fresh or rotten, if it is fresh how much percentage it is fresh and if it rotten how much percentage it is rotten.\\

% First, we have to load both fresh and rotten fruit images in the dataset then we have to split the dataset to train, test and validation. After splitting the dataset, we need to perform augmentation which is rescaling the images to avoid overfitting. After augmentation we need to build the VGG model and train the model. Once the training and validation of model is finished, we need to evaluate the model and finally prediction should be done by testing the model with new fruit images. Then the developed model will give the result of that image as fresh or rotten.

Based on the issues with overfitting risk brought on by huge datasets. The company
analysis of the data revealed that it was inefficient and unsuccessful. Thus, in order to solve the
issue, we will predict the size of a MoD Cloth product for a particular customer using the
Random Forest technique.
The Fit prediction is critical in order to improve customers shopping experiences. This
makes it easier for both the Producers and the consumers to reduce product return rates. The
model helps the customers to know their required product size / fit for a particular mod-cloth.
The system makes advantage of the hips, cup size, bust size, bust, height, fit, shoe size.
With the use of this dataset, an supervised learning model is built, and it is then used to predict
the size by taking the different parameters as input. The project's suggested methodology is
broken down into six steps.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Raw Data
\item  Data Importing

\section{ \Large  Conclusion and Future Scope:}
\end{center}
The project's conclusion is Size and Fit recommendation is an important problem in e-commerce
because it helps customers in choosing the right fit and thereby reduces size and fit related
returns. Most of the earlier works embedded user and product information to predict the right fit.
In this paper, we propose a machine learning based approach to predict the fit based on customer
reviews along with customer and product information. Through extensive experimentation on
different datasets curated from data of one of the largest e-commerce platforms, we show the
effectiveness of our approach.
\\\\
We plan to extend this work by including other customer feedback like customer uploaded
images and customer QnA to predict the right fit. Customers sometimes ask questions related to
size and fit which get answered by other customers who have already bought the product. Also
using customer uploaded images along with product information might help the model to learn
the interactions between user and product to predict the right fit.
